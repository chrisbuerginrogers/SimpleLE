'''
Tap cards, hear what they are, and log every one with its FD02 broadcast.

  >>> Runs ON the M5StickS3, not the Mac. Install it as main.py. <<<
  Needs on the Stick: m5/ (2026-08 or later), lego_card.py, stick_ui.py

This is the card-harvesting tool. Every new card you tap goes into
card_taps.csv on the Stick as one row: the card's RFID UID, its color and
serial, and all twelve bytes of the FD02 service data a device carrying it
broadcasts. That is the pairing needed to attack the open question in
../CLAUDE.md -- what bytes 2 and 7 are a function of.

── How to tap ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two taps per card, in this order:

    1. tap the card on a CONTROLLER or COLOR SENSOR, switched on and nearby
    2. tap the same card on the Stick's RFID reader

Step 1 first, and it is not optional. b2/b7 are not stored on the card, so
the RFID read alone gets you color and serial and nothing else -- the
tokens only exist in what a sender broadcasts. Tapping the sender first
means it is already broadcasting that card by the time the Stick sees it,
so the answer comes back the instant you tap.

Every tap answers immediately. The Stick never waits for a beacon to turn
up, so you can go straight down a stack of cards at whatever pace you like.

The screen fills with the card's own color and names it, and:

    one high beep      the card was read
    two rising notes   the row went into the log
    a low buzz         not a LEGO card, or no beacon on the air for it

If you get the buzz with NO BEACON, step 1 did not happen for that card (or
the sender is out of range or asleep). Tap it on the sender and tap it here
again -- nothing was written, so there is nothing to undo.

── The file ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
card_taps.csv on the Stick, appended to and closed after every row so
pulling the power never costs more than the card in your hand. Fetch it
with:

    python3 mac_fetch_cards.py

Cards already in the file are recognized on the next boot and are not
logged twice -- the counter on screen picks up where it left off. Only
complete rows are written: a card with no beacon is not recorded at all,
so a UID in the file always comes with its twelve bytes.
