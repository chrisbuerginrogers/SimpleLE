'''
stick_ui — the screen and speaker, shared by every Stick example.

  >>> Runs ON the M5StickS3. Needs m5/ on the board. <<<

One look for all the examples: the screen fills with the card's own color and
names it, a short high beep says a card was read, a low buzz says something is
wrong. Written once here so the examples stay short and behave the same.

    ui = stick_ui.UI()
    ui.looking('TAP A CARD')
    ui.card(color, serial)             # fills the screen, beeps
    ui.status('DRIVING')               # a line under the card, color kept
    ui.note('42 LOGGED')               # a second line under that
    ui.saved()                         # two rising notes: written to a file
    ui.problem('NOT A CARD', 'no L3G0 marker')

The screen deliberately keeps showing the last card after it is lifted off the
reader. That card's color and serial are the ones in use, so blanking them
would throw away the answer.

Needs the m5 library from 2026-08 or later -- see the check below the imports.

# The font used to be a 31-glyph subset with 18 of the 26 capitals missing,
# and draw_char() drew anything missing as a blank -- so "ORANGE" came out
# empty and looked like a dead panel rather than a font gap. This file used
# to carry those 18 glyphs and patch them in. m5 ships the full printable
# ASCII range now, so they are gone from here.
